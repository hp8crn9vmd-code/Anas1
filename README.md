## 📂 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

This repository hosts a collection of high-performance interactive graphics modules. Each module is engineered to test specific rendering capabilities, physics simulations, and mathematical visual generation directly in the browser.

| Module ID | System Name | Core Technology | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **001** | [Canvas Engine](./canvas/) | `Vanilla JS` | CPU-based particle system with custom gather/scatter algorithms. |
| **002** | [Spatial Web](./threejs/) | `Three.js` | Immersive 3D architecture featuring PBR materials and dynamic lighting. |
| **003** | [Dynamics Lab](./matterjs/) | `Matter.js` | Rigid body physics engine with collision detection and restitution. |
| **004** | [Render Stress](./pixijs/) | `Pixi.js` | High-throughput 2D rendering benchmark (5000+ entities). |
| **005** | [Shader Core](./webgl/) | `WebGL / GLSL` | Native fragment shader programming for procedural art. |

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

The portfolio is built using a **"Digital Blueprint"** design language, focusing on:

* **Zero-Bloat UI:** Minimalist, data-driven interfaces.
* **Performance First:** Optimized loops for consistent 60 FPS on standard hardware.
* **Modular Codebase:** Each experiment is isolated for independent testing and scaling.

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT

This system is automatically deployed via GitHub Pages.
